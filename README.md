# Design_Strategies
Simple implementations of Design Patterns that I've been trying to implement to improve my OOP. Not as flashy as my other projects but personally it is one of my favourite projects, I plan to read
Design Patterns by the GOF in December this year so hopefully I can add more patterns to this list by then :)
